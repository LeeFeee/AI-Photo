### 8. Chinese Comments
**Status**: ✅ Fully Implemented

All business logic includes Chinese comments explaining:
- Data aggregation calculations (总收入、活跃会员计算)
- Query building and filtering logic (查询条件构建)
- CSV generation logic (CSV导出逻辑)
- Chart data processing (图表数据处理)
- Pagination logic (分页逻辑)
- Status and type mappings (状态和类型映射)

## 📊 Technical Decisions

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Database Indexes**: Added indexes on userId, type, status, and createdAt in Transaction model
2. **Pagination**: Implemented for both users and transactions to prevent loading large datasets
3. **Server Components**: Used Next.js server components for initial data loading
4. **Selective Queries**: Only fetch required fields using Prisma's `select`
5. **Client Components**: Only use "use client" where interactive features are needed (search, filters, charts)

### Data Aggregation
- Used Prisma's `aggregate` for efficient sum calculations
- Grouped transactions by date for chart data
- Filtered active members using database query rather than post-processing

### User Experience
- Color-coded status badges for quick scanning
- Sortable columns with visual indicators
- Clear filter UI with apply/clear actions
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Loading states for better perceived performance

## 🔒 Security Considerations (For Production)

### Authentication Required
- [ ] Implement NextAuth.js or similar
- [ ] Add login/logout pages
- [ ] Session or JWT token management
- [ ] Secure cookie handling

### Authorization Middleware
- [ ] Protect `/admin/*` routes
- [ ] Verify admin role on all admin pages
- [ ] Secure API routes with permission checks
- [ ] Rate limiting on export endpoints

### Database Security
- [ ] Migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL/MySQL
- [ ] Enable SSL connections
- [ ] Implement regular backups
- [ ] Use environment variables for sensitive data

### Password Security
- [ ] Hash passwords with bcrypt
- [ ] Implement password reset flow
- [ ] Add password strength requirements
